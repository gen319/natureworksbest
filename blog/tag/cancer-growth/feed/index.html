								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Colleen Huber, NMD</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>If there was a single treatment that I could give to my cancer patients, one that is free of charge for life, tremendously effective and much safer to have than not have, that would be exercise.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Conversely, I have never seen any more widespread threats to duration and quality of life than these three risky behaviors: reckless driving, recreational substance abuse and a sedentary lifestyle.  Reckless driving, fortunately, is relatively rare, as most of us seem to be able to stay in our lane and stop at the red lights, with some remarkable and hair-raising exceptions on our roads and highways.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>However, the most common major reckless behavior of our time, sedentary lifestyle, is casually indulged by a majority of 21<sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">st</span></sup> century Americans.  It is casually indulged, as if there were no victims to this behavior, and as if no harm is expected to come of it.  Both assumptions are false, for the following reasons.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>The American College of Sports Medicine recommends 150 minutes of exercise per week, broken up into any intervals, of any combination of sports or other movement, <i><u>for every living person</u></i>.  To state the obvious but incomprehensible:  This means you -regardless of who you are, your age, your pathetic excuses or your health condition.  This recommendation is for Americans of both genders and every last generation even at the extremes, and it is seconded by the Centers for Disease Control.<a id="_0"></a><a href="#_8"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">i</span></sup></a>  The benefits of long-term exercise have been known throughout human history.  Hippocrates warned circa 400 BC, “Eating alone will not keep a man well.  He must also take exercise.”<a id="_1"></a><a href="#_11"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">ii</span></sup></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>I cannot tell you how many sedentary people come in to me amazed when they do not get better, having not comprehended my many exhortations to move and to move frequently, and that their very lives depend on it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Yet contemporary Americans are content to leave sports to star athletes and youthful up-and-comers.  Only 1 in 5 Americans get the recommended 150 minutes of exercise per week.  The rest are literally time bombs for chronic disease.  Worse yet, nearly half of high school students – at or near peak physical performance of their lives &#8211; do not have a weekly PE class.<a id="_2"></a><a href="#_14"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">iii</span></sup></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>The recklessness of not exercising includes a greatly increased risk for Alzheimer’s Disease, as exercise is now known as the most effective intervention against onset and progression of Alzheimer’s.  This poses a threat not only to the wellbeing and quality of life of the individual, but to his safety and that of his family.  Likewise, the older woman who chooses not to exercise has increasingly brittle bones, a life-threatening hip fracture waiting to happen.  Pre-diabetes and full-blown Type II diabetes are far more prevalent among the sedentary, because lack of exercise impedes blood sugar metabolism.</p>
<p>The most stubbornly sedentary among us may be asking why humans are cursed with exercise as a pre-requisite and co-requisite of good health.  I may as well ask why I was cursed with having to nag people to move day after day and decade after decade, in order to help them to get well.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>But it is not only these diseases that are very high risk for those with a sedentary lifestyle.  Cancer is more likely to strike the sedentary than the non-sedentary.   There you have it – the cause of cancer:</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>In an experiment with mice that were genetically disposed to age prematurely, Mark Tarnopolsky of McMaster University in Ontario, divided the mice into two groups.  The first group of mice were sedentary.  The second group were coaxed on a treadmill three times per week.  As expected, the sedentary mice had weaker hearts, thin fur, worse hearing and were shivering in a corner.   The healthy mice had sleek coats, ran around their cages, reproduced.  However, with regard to cancer, when the mice were sacrificed at the end of the study, half of the sedentary mice had tumors.  <i>None</i> of the active mice had any tumors at all.<a id="_3"></a><a href="#_17"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">iv</span></sup></a>  None!</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>There could not be a more stark contrast between a group that’s high risk for cancer and a group that’s low risk than these sedentary versus active mice.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>In my clinic, I exhort people to exercise, and I see all kinds of people.  Some are already on their treadmills or other exercise of their choice.  The majority tell me they don’t exercise much, and that they don’t mind going for a walk in the cool weather.  Here in the Phoenix area, some consider cool weather to be only the six months from mid-October to early April.  So I often hear from patients that they don’t want to walk, or haven’t been walking because it’s too hot.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>We look for other forms of exercise that they would be willing to do.  We talk about in-home equipment, such as weights and stationary bikes.  I tell them that if they live close to a tennis court, they’ll play more tennis than me, or if they have a pool, that would be a great option.  Very many of my cancer patients find any exercise anathema, and content themselves with making plans for future exercise, rather than getting up today to start moving.  Sometimes the late-stage patients decide that they want to spend their days in a wheelchair, rather than the walker that we agreed on.  I almost always hate to see this, because, unless they are willing to lift weights and do some aerobic exercises while in the chair, I think the very act of starting to spend time in a wheelchair is going to shorten their lives.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>But I am not giving up on any of my patients.  The ones in wheelchairs should lift cans of soup or similar weights, for 10 to 20 reps, 3 times per day.  The mobile patients should find ways to get to the 150 minutes or more.  I exercise about 270 minutes per week, and encourage that for the more fit ones.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Then there are those who insist that, either by laziness or inconvenience or distaste, they will not exercise, I tell them that they need to get into my hyperbaric chamber (HBOT) instead – a more expensive, and possibly not quite as good, alternative to exercise.   I recommend this second alternative, the HBOT, so that we can at least accomplish the major benefit that exercise confers in fighting cancer – the benefit of oxygen.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Oxygen uptake is perhaps the best benefit of exercise to a cancer patient.  Intense exercise maximizes oxygen uptake.  Oxygen at the cellular level is absolutely necessary to nourish our cells, to produce energy, to disassemble and eliminate waste products from our cells, to balance pH and to enhance our immune function.  These are essential tasks for the cells of non-cancer and cancer patients alike.  These tasks are necessary in the tissue of the cancer patient that we are trying to protect from metastasis, as well as for the tissue already damaged by cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Decreased blood and oxygen flow to vital organs create the setting in which cancer takes its very first stab at the body.  In fact, a carcinogen, as defined by Otto Warburg, is a substance that deprives a cell of oxygen, and that causes that cell to convert from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism – the metabolism of cancer cells.  This, as Warburg showed almost 100 years ago, is the initial cause of cancer.  He studied many carcinogens, and found that what they had in common, every single one, was the ability to block the cell’s uptake of oxygen.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>When you consider all the wasted research dollars and time attempting to chase quickly mutating genes to try to associate one more with cancer than others, with vanishing results, as one expensive lab test cannot reproduce another, the answer was right there all the time, and it is this:</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>All cancer arises from oxygen deprivation to the cells.  All carcinogens have in common that they deprive cells of oxygen.  And the first part of the cell damaged is not the DNA, not the genes, not at all.  The first part of the cell that is damaged is the mitochondria, site of oxygen utilization and the electron transport chain.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Warburg said, “Cancer has only one prime cause.  The prime cause of cancer is the replacement of normal oxygen respiration of body cells by an anaerobic cell respiration.<a id="_4"></a><a href="#_19"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">v</span></sup></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Cancer seems to be an “obligate anaerobe,” that is, that it requires to some extent an oxygen-free environment.<a id="_5"></a><a href="#_22"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">vi</span></sup></a>  To the extent this is true, it makes cancer treatment easier.  Our solution: provide oxygen to the patient.  How do we do that?  If the sedentary patient sits comfortably while hooked up to an oxygen tank, this is not the best way to aerate the body.  Only the blood flow and increased lung work induced by exercise will get oxygen efficiently used in the body.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>The point of all that effort is to get oxygen into the cell.  Let’s examine what happens when a normal cell receives increased oxygen.  Oxidative phosphorylation is the primary metabolic pathway.   The electron transport chain is engaged, as well the citric acid cycle, and the mitochondria are able to function in providing energy to the cell, to carry out cell functions, to thrive, eliminate wastes and reproduce.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>In a cancerous cell, which is a formerly normal but now damaged cell, cellular respiration has converted to anaerobic.  When these cells are oxygenated, the remaining normal mitochondria in the previously damaged cell are able to return to normal function and resume metabolism as a normal cell.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Another oxygenating treatment that we do at my clinic is ozone.  Whereas oxygen is found in nature as O2, which is two oxygen molecules covalently bonded together, ozone is O3.  When we combine ozone with the cancer patient’s blood, in a short time the O3 breaks into O2 and a single O, which then is attracted to and grabs any nearby anaerobes.  This includes not only viruses and bacteria, but also cancer cells, destroying them.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Cancer cells have been shown in numerous studies to die in the presence of even a small amount of ozone.  One study showed lung, breast and uterine cancers dying at only 0.3 to 0.8 parts ozone per million, with the higher concentration killing more of the cancer cells.<a id="_6"></a><a href="#_25"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">vii</span></sup></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Likewise, hyperbaric oxygen therapy works similarly, yet more effectively.  By increasing pressure of room air in a closed environment, more oxygen from the room air is forced into the body and into the blood.  By Henry’s law, we know that pressure increases the plasma concentration of a gas.  In the case of 1.3 atm of room air, the resulting concentration of oxygen in the plasma is increased by 50%.<a id="_7"></a><a href="#_28"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">viii</span></sup></a>  HBOT treatments have been a wonderful boon to natural health care, with very far ranging effects from neurological repair of many kinds, its most lauded and noteworthy effect, to wound-healing and the disruption of cancer metabolism.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">Colleen Huber, NMD</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>O</strong>ur clinic which focuses on holistic, naturopathic, and alternative cancer treatments conducted the largest and longest study on sugar consumption in cancer patients, and the results were stark. Previous research has shown that high blood sugar has been risky for certain types of cancer. However, those studies were either on mice or on fewer than 20 human cancer patients. This 7-year ongoing study at our clinic has involved 317 cancer patients. We asked them to avoid all sweetened foods, except for stevia-sweetened foods. Continuing to eat sugar and sugary foods made a significant difference in survival for all stages of cancer and all types of cancer. Regardless of the type of cancer or the stage, sugar avoiders had more than twice the survival (90%) of the sugar eaters (36%). We therefore have to recommend that the diet of cancer patients not contain desserts, soda or other sweets. These results were originally published in Cancer Strategies Journal, Spring 2014.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;"><span id="g1-dropcap-1" class="g1-dropcap g1-dropcap--simple " ><span><span style="font-size: 54pt;">S</span></span></span>ince 2006, our clinic has collected information on sugar and cancer patients, and has actively recommended that all cancer patients avoid sweetened foods. This clinic has no food service, and is entirely an outpatient clinic. All patients chose all of their own food. We included all 317 patients who came to us with a diagnosis of cancer, and who stayed for at least two weeks in our care.</p>
<div id="g1-box-counter-1" class="g1-box g1-box--simple  g1-box--noicon" ><div class="g1-box__inner">

<blockquote>
<h3>Regardless of the type of cancer or the stage, sugar avoiders had more than twice the survival (90%) of the sugar eaters (36%).&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
</div></div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">We treated our cancer paitents with natural methods alone, using research-established anti-cancer nutrients and herbs such as <a title="The Baking Soda Cancer Treatment" href="https://natureworksbest.com/dr-tullio-simoncini-sodium-bicarbonate-cancer-treatment/">sodium bicarbonate </a>and <a title="Our Vitamin-C Cancer Therapy" href="https://natureworksbest.com/vitamin-c-cancer-therapy/">Vitamin C</a>. These were given in IV and oral form. The high dose nutrient injections were chosen for being easily tolerated, working compatibly or synergistically with each other and for having strong anti-cancer effect. We are a naturopathic clinic, and we use the naturopathic principle of “Treat the whole person.” So the treatments are adjusted to fit individual needs and tolerance.</p>
<p>Choosing a good diet is of utmost importance in cancer therapy, particularly keeping blood sugar low. <strong>The existing research on the subject shows that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tumors grow as blood sugar goes higher, there is a connection between sugar and cancer</span>.</strong> This has been shown for several types of cancer: pancreatic cancer,<sup>1 2 3 4</sup> breast cancer,<sup>5 6 7 8&nbsp;</sup> prostate cancer,<sup>9 10</sup> gastric cancer, <sup>11 12</sup> colorectal cancer,<sup>13 14 15 16</sup> ovarian cancer,<sup>17 18</sup> endometrial cancer,<sup>19 20</sup> and liver and biliary tract cancers.<sup>21 22</sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Given all of this evidence, it would be reckless for a physician to allow a cancer patient to assume that sugar intake is harmless. We therefore ask all of our cancer patients to avoid sugar and other sweeteners, such as honey, maple syrup, molasses, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, alcohol, alcohol sugars and plant nectars, as well as fruit juices, because such foods tend to push the blood sugar highest (raising the glycemic index – See box). Use of stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) is encouraged if and when a sweetener is desired.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;"><div id="g1-box-counter-2" class="g1-box g1-box--simple  g1-box--noicon" ><div class="g1-box__inner">

<blockquote>
<h3>What is the glycemic index?</h3>
<h3>The glycemic index of a food assigns a number value to the rise in blood sugar after eating that food. This varies a lot from food to food, from unripe fruit to ripe fruit, and even from person to person. After a meal, your blood sugar goes up. But after a dessert, it goes up very quickly and far. Charts showing the glycemic index of different foods can be found online.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;"></div></div></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Stevia tastes sweet, in fact about 300 times sweeter than sugar. This has led to a common problem: People who are unfamiliar with it use way too much. Stevia has to be used in really tiny amounts to give just a pleasant sweet taste. But when you use too much, you are overwhelmed by such a sweet taste, that it actually gives the impression of being a little bitter. Some people seem to get turned off for life after such an experience. This is really unfortunate, because of the huge health benefits that stevia has to offer.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Stevia has actually been shown to lower blood sugar, even though it tastes sweet,<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>23</sup></a> and has even been shown to be helpful for diabetics.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote2sym" name="sdendnote2anc"><sup>24</sup></a> Fortunately, the sweet molecules in stevia do not enter the bloodstream.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote3sym" name="sdendnote3anc"><sup>25</sup></a> Cancer thrives when it gets sugar delivered to it by the blood. This is the main way that cancer is able to grow. Sugar is its main fuel. So it is very useful that stevia can give the sweet tooth a treat while depriving the tumor of sugar.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">For the same reason, we asked patients to also limit other refined carbohydrates, specifically flour products, because these also raise blood sugar. Whole natural foods: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, eggs, dairy and other animal proteins are encouraged as the entire diet, with the widest available variety in those groups. Many patients arrive to our clinic already consuming all of those types of foods. Others arrive with different diets. Some patients have chosen a vegan diet. Others have chosen an ovo-lacto-vegetarian diet. Many others are omnivores. Others avoid grains altogether. We have not actively pushed our patients to one or the other of these diets, because we tried to maintain the primary dietary focus on the avoidance of sweeteners, without distraction by other dietary priorities. We keep the focus exclusively on the avoidance of sugar and cancer patients&nbsp; easily remember that one guideline.</p>
<div id="g1-box-counter-3" class="g1-box g1-box--simple  g1-box--noicon" ><div class="g1-box__inner">
<span id="g1-space-3" class="g1-space " style="margin-top:-1.5em;"></span>
<blockquote>
<h2>Our patients may eat absolutely anything they like, but we strongly urge the avoidance of sweeteners; except for stevia.&#8221;</h2>
</blockquote>
</div></div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Through repeated reminding, with gentle, encouraging consultation and troubleshooting of sugar and cancer, as well as brainstorming of alternative foods that may satisfy those cravings, during patient consults, we create a situation where our patients are unlikely to completely forget our recommendation when given a choice of whether to have dessert or skip dessert.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">The overwhelming influence of the oncology profession on diet has suppressed this type of recommendation among many physicians. Chemotherapy IV rooms are known for having candy dishes in plain sight, despite our research that sugar and cancer are a deadly combination. Most oncologists have generally recommended that cancer patients eat desserts so intently that it seems the patients’ primary responsibility is to keep their weight up, without regard for specific health effects of various foods. Under this sugar-oriented food culture, both in the American culture at large and in the oncology clinic, other physicians tend to give in to the oncologists on this point.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">However, when we started this dietary recommendation to our cancer patients in 2006, the time was already more than ripe to rebel against the sweet-tooth trend, because most of the above-cited research on sugar consumption and tumor growth had already been published. So at our clinic we decided to acknowledge the little known but already well-established connection between sugar and cancer, and thus to recommend sugar avoidance to our cancer patients.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sugar and Cancer Growth</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">And Its Effect On The Body</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">&nbsp;So let’s look at what we mean by “sugar.” Commonly the word “sugar” means sucrose, derived from sugar cane. Sucrose is a compound of glucose and fructose, and sugar is composed equally of both. High-fructose corn syrup is similar, except that it has a higher proportion of fructose to glucose. 80% of sucrose used worldwide is from cane sugar; most of the rest is from beets. It is already common knowledge that sugar is “empty calories,” that is, no protein or fat or complex carbohydrates. In its refined form it contains no nutrients at all, no vitamins, minerals, flavonoids or other antioxidants, no fiber, no amino acids. However, sugar is far more damaging to the health than simply the null effect of empty calories.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Sugar consumption was thought be 40 pounds per person per year in the U.S. in 1986.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>26</sup></a> By the early 2000s, Americans were consuming 90 pounds per person per year, which coincided with the time that one-third of Americans were obese and 14 million were diabetic.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote2sym" name="sdendnote2anc"><sup>27</sup></a> Population studies have confirmed these findings in various countries, but the idea that sugar could be a health risk fell into disfavor in the 1970s, as American nutritionists at that time followed unquestioningly Ancel Keys and his Seven Countries Study. This study, blaming saturated fat for cardiovascular disease, had actually been a 22-country study, in which those countries that contradicted Keys’ opinions were quietly dropped from the discussion. Incidentally, those same countries were found to have a direct relationship between sugar consumption and heart disease, but that was not the widely publicized conclusion. Saturated fat became the scapegoat. In the following decades, salt would come to play the role of villain. As country after country fell victim to the damaging effects of sugar in the diet, one scapegoat after another took the blame.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">The British physiologist John Yudkin found an effect of sugar consumption on obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease,<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote3sym" name="sdendnote3anc"><sup>28</sup></a> and brought the public’s attention to the health effects of sucrose in his 1972 book <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pure, White and Deadly</span>.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote4sym" name="sdendnote4anc"><sup>29</sup></a> Yudkin was often personally attacked, often viciously, for writing about the diseases either caused by or worsened by sugar. In 1975, William Dufty challenged the conventional thinking on sugar with his bestseller <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sugar Blues</span>.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote5sym" name="sdendnote5anc"><sup>v</sup></a> Then Nancy Appleton wrote “141 Reasons Sugar Ruins Your Health,”<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote6sym" name="sdendnote6anc"><sup>30</sup></a> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lick the Sugar Habit</span>.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote7sym" name="sdendnote7anc"><sup>31</sup></a> In the last few years, Robert Lustig has explained the widespread damage in a way that the public is beginning to appreciate. But the best at breaking down the chemistry to clear language as well as the politics, intrigue and history of American food fights is journalist Gary Taubes, author of “Is Sugar Toxic?”<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote8sym" name="sdendnote8anc"><sup>32</sup></a> as well as the decade-old but still current “What If It’s All Been A Big, Fat Lie?”<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote9sym" name="sdendnote9anc"><sup>33</sup></a> and “Why We Get Fat.”<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote10sym" name="sdendnote10anc"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">A rapid rise in blood sugar quickly follows ingestion of pure sucrose, or sucrose-rich solids and especially liquids. Sweets accompanied by fats, proteins or fiber will enter the bloodstream slower than sweets alone in a refined carbohydrate vehicle, such as a cookie. But whether fast or slow, insulin is secreted by the pancreas in response to the presence of sugar in the blood. A lot of sudden sugar in the blood results in a lot of insulin secreted by the pancreas. When that happens too much or for too many years, the pancreas becomes depleted and can’t keep up with the body’s demand for insulin. Blood sugar rises beyond normal range, and diabetes is the diagnosis. In animal studies of sugar bingeing this process began in only a few weeks.</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; text-align: center;">Cancer Growth</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Tumor growth is thought to occur by way of insulin delivering sugar to cells. Cancer cells are thought to be more dependent than normal cells on sugar and cancer appears to be insatiable. Cancer’s rapid growth seems to place no limit on the sugar it can use. Insulin delivers that sugar.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Does this mean that starving the cancer cell of sugar kills the cancer cell? It is true that cancer patients on a ketogenic diet, which is a very low carbohydrate diet, seem to do somewhat better than other cancer patients. In the classic ketogenic diet, fat outweighs the total of protein and carbohydrates 4 to 1 by weight, and total carbohydrates is no more than 20 to 40 grams per day. The classic ketogenic diet eliminates simple and many complex carbohydrates: sweeteners, fruits, grains, and starchy vegetables. In animal studies, a ketogenic diet was found either to reduce the tumor size or slow tumor growth in glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer,<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote11sym" name="sdendnote11anc"><sup>35</sup></a> prostate cancer,<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote12sym" name="sdendnote12anc"><sup>36</sup></a> gastric cancer,<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote13sym" name="sdendnote13anc"><sup>37</sup></a> and lung cancer.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote14sym" name="sdendnote14anc"><sup>38</sup></a> It was also found to improve quality of life in patients with late stage disease in a variety of cancers.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote15sym" name="sdendnote15anc"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">From these observations, we may not be able to jump all the way to the conclusion that sugar causes cancer, or even that getting rid of sugar gets rid of cancer. However, we can certainly become alert to the sugar and cancer connection, a cancer patient’s risks in continuing to eat sugar, and the possible benefit from eliminating it from the diet.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; text-align: center;"><b>Results</b></h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Regarding the patients at our clinic, 29 patients acknowledged to us that they had fallen off the wagon; that is, that they ate sweetened foods at some time during their treatment. The doctors and staff try never to have a judgmental approach to our patients. If a patient has acknowledged that he or she has not abstained from sweets entirely, then we take a co-responsible (some might call it co-dependent) approach. We take responsibility for not doing a good enough job to encourage or offer ideas for satisfactory substitutes for sweets. So then during one-on-one consults we try to offer more, and more individually applicable, suggestions for the sweet cravings. For example, one person may be more drawn to alcohol, while another is more drawn to chocolate. Yet another may have a coffee habit in which coffee tastes bad without sugar. For others, it is ice cream that they want. Whether we were successful or not in persuading such individuals to adopt our recommended diet, we report that category of patient below as one who disregarded our dietary recommendation, unless they agreed to give up sweets at the beginning of treatment and stayed steadfast in that diet.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Our data is reported as of July 1, 2013. 20 patients died while still exclusively in our care, following all of our protocols, including dietary. These were all types of cancer and all stages of cancer, especially the more advanced stages. 12 more died while still in our care, but having ignored one of our main treatment recommendations, that is to avoid sweetened foods. 16 of our cancer patients have come out of remission. 5 of those are now back in remission. 4 of those 16 had discontinued our main dietary recommendation.</p>

<p>Tables 1, 2 and 3 show comparable information for three groups of patients: Table 1 summarizes all patients who presented to our clinic for cancer treatment, and who stayed in our treatments for at least two weeks. Table 2 shows the same information for those who chose to eat sweetened foods. Table 3 shows the same information for those who chose to avoid sweetened foods. The remission rate is different for all patients: 151 / 317 = 48% and those who ate sweetened foods: 9 / 29 = 31% and those who avoided sweetened foods: 142 / 288 = 49%. However, the difference in these three groups is even more pronounced if we consider those patients who stayed with our treatments until either remission or death, as in Tables 4, 5 and 6.</p>

<p>Comparing all patients who were steadfast in the treatments (Table 4) with the sweetened food eaters, who were steadfast in all but dietary recommendations (Table 5), we see that 151 / 183 = 83% went into remission, but only 9 / 25 = 36% of the sweetened food eaters went into remission. 90% of the steadfast patients who avoided sweeteners went into remission.<br />
Of all patients who were steadfast in the treatments, (including our sweetened food eaters), 32 / 183 = 17% died, but considering only the sweetened food eaters who were otherwise steadfast in the treatments, 16 / 25 = 64% died. Of the steadfast patients who avoided sweeteners, 16 / 158 = 10% died.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Consuming sweetened foods (other than stevia sweetened foods) made a significant difference in patient outcome across both all stages and all types of cancer among patients presenting to our clinic. Therefore, we recommend that the diet of cancer patients not contain sweeteners other than stevia.</p>
