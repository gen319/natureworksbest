<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sugar and Cancer is There a Connection?</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://natureworksbest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Sugar-Cancer-Study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View the Study</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Colleen Huber, NMD</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>O</strong>ur clinic which focuses on holistic, naturopathic, and alternative cancer treatments conducted the largest and longest study on sugar consumption in cancer patients, and the results were stark. Previous research has shown that high blood sugar has been risky for certain types of cancer. However, those studies were either on mice or on fewer than 20 human cancer patients. This 7-year ongoing study at our clinic has involved 317 cancer patients. We asked them to avoid all sweetened foods, except for stevia-sweetened foods. Continuing to eat sugar and sugary foods made a significant difference in survival for all stages of cancer and all types of cancer. Regardless of the type of cancer or the stage, sugar avoiders had more than twice the survival (90%) of the sugar eaters (36%). We therefore have to recommend that the diet of cancer patients not contain desserts, soda or other sweets. These results were originally published in Cancer Strategies Journal, Spring 2014.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;"><span id="g1-dropcap-1" class="g1-dropcap g1-dropcap--simple " ><span><span style="font-size: 54pt;">S</span></span></span>ince 2006, our clinic has collected information on sugar and cancer patients, and has actively recommended that all cancer patients avoid sweetened foods. This clinic has no food service, and is entirely an outpatient clinic. All patients chose all of their own food. We included all 317 patients who came to us with a diagnosis of cancer, and who stayed for at least two weeks in our care.</p>
<div id="g1-box-counter-1" class="g1-box g1-box--simple  g1-box--noicon" ><div class="g1-box__inner">
<span id="g1-space-1" class="g1-space " style="margin-top:-1.5em;"></span>
<blockquote>
<h3>Regardless of the type of cancer or the stage, sugar avoiders had more than twice the survival (90%) of the sugar eaters (36%).&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
</div></div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">We treated our cancer paitents with natural methods alone, using research-established anti-cancer nutrients and herbs such as <a title="The Baking Soda Cancer Treatment" href="https://natureworksbest.com/dr-tullio-simoncini-sodium-bicarbonate-cancer-treatment/">sodium bicarbonate </a>and <a title="Our Vitamin-C Cancer Therapy" href="https://natureworksbest.com/vitamin-c-cancer-therapy/">Vitamin C</a>. These were given in IV and oral form. The high dose nutrient injections were chosen for being easily tolerated, working compatibly or synergistically with each other and for having strong anti-cancer effect. We are a naturopathic clinic, and we use the naturopathic principle of “Treat the whole person.” So the treatments are adjusted to fit individual needs and tolerance.</p>
<p>Choosing a good diet is of utmost importance in cancer therapy, particularly keeping blood sugar low. <strong>The existing research on the subject shows that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tumors grow as blood sugar goes higher, there is a connection between sugar and cancer</span>.</strong> This has been shown for several types of cancer: pancreatic cancer,<sup>1 2 3 4</sup> breast cancer,<sup>5 6 7 8&nbsp;</sup> prostate cancer,<sup>9 10</sup> gastric cancer, <sup>11 12</sup> colorectal cancer,<sup>13 14 15 16</sup> ovarian cancer,<sup>17 18</sup> endometrial cancer,<sup>19 20</sup> and liver and biliary tract cancers.<sup>21 22</sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Given all of this evidence, it would be reckless for a physician to allow a cancer patient to assume that sugar intake is harmless. We therefore ask all of our cancer patients to avoid sugar and other sweeteners, such as honey, maple syrup, molasses, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, alcohol, alcohol sugars and plant nectars, as well as fruit juices, because such foods tend to push the blood sugar highest (raising the glycemic index – See box). Use of stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) is encouraged if and when a sweetener is desired.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;"><div id="g1-box-counter-2" class="g1-box g1-box--simple  g1-box--noicon" ><div class="g1-box__inner">
<span id="g1-space-2" class="g1-space " style="margin-top:-1.5em;"></span>
<blockquote>
<h3>What is the glycemic index?</h3>
<h3>The glycemic index of a food assigns a number value to the rise in blood sugar after eating that food. This varies a lot from food to food, from unripe fruit to ripe fruit, and even from person to person. After a meal, your blood sugar goes up. But after a dessert, it goes up very quickly and far. Charts showing the glycemic index of different foods can be found online.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;"></div></div></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Stevia tastes sweet, in fact about 300 times sweeter than sugar. This has led to a common problem: People who are unfamiliar with it use way too much. Stevia has to be used in really tiny amounts to give just a pleasant sweet taste. But when you use too much, you are overwhelmed by such a sweet taste, that it actually gives the impression of being a little bitter. Some people seem to get turned off for life after such an experience. This is really unfortunate, because of the huge health benefits that stevia has to offer.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Stevia has actually been shown to lower blood sugar, even though it tastes sweet,<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>23</sup></a> and has even been shown to be helpful for diabetics.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote2sym" name="sdendnote2anc"><sup>24</sup></a> Fortunately, the sweet molecules in stevia do not enter the bloodstream.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote3sym" name="sdendnote3anc"><sup>25</sup></a> Cancer thrives when it gets sugar delivered to it by the blood. This is the main way that cancer is able to grow. Sugar is its main fuel. So it is very useful that stevia can give the sweet tooth a treat while depriving the tumor of sugar.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">For the same reason, we asked patients to also limit other refined carbohydrates, specifically flour products, because these also raise blood sugar. Whole natural foods: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, eggs, dairy and other animal proteins are encouraged as the entire diet, with the widest available variety in those groups. Many patients arrive to our clinic already consuming all of those types of foods. Others arrive with different diets. Some patients have chosen a vegan diet. Others have chosen an ovo-lacto-vegetarian diet. Many others are omnivores. Others avoid grains altogether. We have not actively pushed our patients to one or the other of these diets, because we tried to maintain the primary dietary focus on the avoidance of sweeteners, without distraction by other dietary priorities. We keep the focus exclusively on the avoidance of sugar and cancer patients&nbsp; easily remember that one guideline.</p>
<div id="g1-box-counter-3" class="g1-box g1-box--simple  g1-box--noicon" ><div class="g1-box__inner">
<span id="g1-space-3" class="g1-space " style="margin-top:-1.5em;"></span>
<blockquote>
<h2>Our patients may eat absolutely anything they like, but we strongly urge the avoidance of sweeteners; except for stevia.&#8221;</h2>
</blockquote>
</div></div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Through repeated reminding, with gentle, encouraging consultation and troubleshooting of sugar and cancer, as well as brainstorming of alternative foods that may satisfy those cravings, during patient consults, we create a situation where our patients are unlikely to completely forget our recommendation when given a choice of whether to have dessert or skip dessert.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">The overwhelming influence of the oncology profession on diet has suppressed this type of recommendation among many physicians. Chemotherapy IV rooms are known for having candy dishes in plain sight, despite our research that sugar and cancer are a deadly combination. Most oncologists have generally recommended that cancer patients eat desserts so intently that it seems the patients’ primary responsibility is to keep their weight up, without regard for specific health effects of various foods. Under this sugar-oriented food culture, both in the American culture at large and in the oncology clinic, other physicians tend to give in to the oncologists on this point.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">However, when we started this dietary recommendation to our cancer patients in 2006, the time was already more than ripe to rebel against the sweet-tooth trend, because most of the above-cited research on sugar consumption and tumor growth had already been published. So at our clinic we decided to acknowledge the little known but already well-established connection between sugar and cancer, and thus to recommend sugar avoidance to our cancer patients.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sugar and Cancer Growth</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">And Its Effect On The Body</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">&nbsp;So let’s look at what we mean by “sugar.” Commonly the word “sugar” means sucrose, derived from sugar cane. Sucrose is a compound of glucose and fructose, and sugar is composed equally of both. High-fructose corn syrup is similar, except that it has a higher proportion of fructose to glucose. 80% of sucrose used worldwide is from cane sugar; most of the rest is from beets. It is already common knowledge that sugar is “empty calories,” that is, no protein or fat or complex carbohydrates. In its refined form it contains no nutrients at all, no vitamins, minerals, flavonoids or other antioxidants, no fiber, no amino acids. However, sugar is far more damaging to the health than simply the null effect of empty calories.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Sugar consumption was thought be 40 pounds per person per year in the U.S. in 1986.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>26</sup></a> By the early 2000s, Americans were consuming 90 pounds per person per year, which coincided with the time that one-third of Americans were obese and 14 million were diabetic.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote2sym" name="sdendnote2anc"><sup>27</sup></a> Population studies have confirmed these findings in various countries, but the idea that sugar could be a health risk fell into disfavor in the 1970s, as American nutritionists at that time followed unquestioningly Ancel Keys and his Seven Countries Study. This study, blaming saturated fat for cardiovascular disease, had actually been a 22-country study, in which those countries that contradicted Keys’ opinions were quietly dropped from the discussion. Incidentally, those same countries were found to have a direct relationship between sugar consumption and heart disease, but that was not the widely publicized conclusion. Saturated fat became the scapegoat. In the following decades, salt would come to play the role of villain. As country after country fell victim to the damaging effects of sugar in the diet, one scapegoat after another took the blame.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">The British physiologist John Yudkin found an effect of sugar consumption on obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease,<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote3sym" name="sdendnote3anc"><sup>28</sup></a> and brought the public’s attention to the health effects of sucrose in his 1972 book <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pure, White and Deadly</span>.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote4sym" name="sdendnote4anc"><sup>29</sup></a> Yudkin was often personally attacked, often viciously, for writing about the diseases either caused by or worsened by sugar. In 1975, William Dufty challenged the conventional thinking on sugar with his bestseller <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sugar Blues</span>.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote5sym" name="sdendnote5anc"><sup>v</sup></a> Then Nancy Appleton wrote “141 Reasons Sugar Ruins Your Health,”<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote6sym" name="sdendnote6anc"><sup>30</sup></a> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lick the Sugar Habit</span>.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote7sym" name="sdendnote7anc"><sup>31</sup></a> In the last few years, Robert Lustig has explained the widespread damage in a way that the public is beginning to appreciate. But the best at breaking down the chemistry to clear language as well as the politics, intrigue and history of American food fights is journalist Gary Taubes, author of “Is Sugar Toxic?”<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote8sym" name="sdendnote8anc"><sup>32</sup></a> as well as the decade-old but still current “What If It’s All Been A Big, Fat Lie?”<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote9sym" name="sdendnote9anc"><sup>33</sup></a> and “Why We Get Fat.”<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote10sym" name="sdendnote10anc"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">A rapid rise in blood sugar quickly follows ingestion of pure sucrose, or sucrose-rich solids and especially liquids. Sweets accompanied by fats, proteins or fiber will enter the bloodstream slower than sweets alone in a refined carbohydrate vehicle, such as a cookie. But whether fast or slow, insulin is secreted by the pancreas in response to the presence of sugar in the blood. A lot of sudden sugar in the blood results in a lot of insulin secreted by the pancreas. When that happens too much or for too many years, the pancreas becomes depleted and can’t keep up with the body’s demand for insulin. Blood sugar rises beyond normal range, and diabetes is the diagnosis. In animal studies of sugar bingeing this process began in only a few weeks.</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; text-align: center;">Cancer Growth</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Tumor growth is thought to occur by way of insulin delivering sugar to cells. Cancer cells are thought to be more dependent than normal cells on sugar and cancer appears to be insatiable. Cancer’s rapid growth seems to place no limit on the sugar it can use. Insulin delivers that sugar.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Does this mean that starving the cancer cell of sugar kills the cancer cell? It is true that cancer patients on a ketogenic diet, which is a very low carbohydrate diet, seem to do somewhat better than other cancer patients. In the classic ketogenic diet, fat outweighs the total of protein and carbohydrates 4 to 1 by weight, and total carbohydrates is no more than 20 to 40 grams per day. The classic ketogenic diet eliminates simple and many complex carbohydrates: sweeteners, fruits, grains, and starchy vegetables. In animal studies, a ketogenic diet was found either to reduce the tumor size or slow tumor growth in glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer,<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote11sym" name="sdendnote11anc"><sup>35</sup></a> prostate cancer,<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote12sym" name="sdendnote12anc"><sup>36</sup></a> gastric cancer,<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote13sym" name="sdendnote13anc"><sup>37</sup></a> and lung cancer.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote14sym" name="sdendnote14anc"><sup>38</sup></a> It was also found to improve quality of life in patients with late stage disease in a variety of cancers.<a class="sdendnoteanc" href="#sdendnote15sym" name="sdendnote15anc"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">From these observations, we may not be able to jump all the way to the conclusion that sugar causes cancer, or even that getting rid of sugar gets rid of cancer. However, we can certainly become alert to the sugar and cancer connection, a cancer patient’s risks in continuing to eat sugar, and the possible benefit from eliminating it from the diet.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; text-align: center;"><b>Results</b></h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Regarding the patients at our clinic, 29 patients acknowledged to us that they had fallen off the wagon; that is, that they ate sweetened foods at some time during their treatment. The doctors and staff try never to have a judgmental approach to our patients. If a patient has acknowledged that he or she has not abstained from sweets entirely, then we take a co-responsible (some might call it co-dependent) approach. We take responsibility for not doing a good enough job to encourage or offer ideas for satisfactory substitutes for sweets. So then during one-on-one consults we try to offer more, and more individually applicable, suggestions for the sweet cravings. For example, one person may be more drawn to alcohol, while another is more drawn to chocolate. Yet another may have a coffee habit in which coffee tastes bad without sugar. For others, it is ice cream that they want. Whether we were successful or not in persuading such individuals to adopt our recommended diet, we report that category of patient below as one who disregarded our dietary recommendation, unless they agreed to give up sweets at the beginning of treatment and stayed steadfast in that diet.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in;">Our data is reported as of July 1, 2013. 20 patients died while still exclusively in our care, following all of our protocols, including dietary. These were all types of cancer and all stages of cancer, especially the more advanced stages. 12 more died while still in our care, but having ignored one of our main treatment recommendations, that is to avoid sweetened foods. 16 of our cancer patients have come out of remission. 5 of those are now back in remission. 4 of those 16 had discontinued our main dietary recommendation.</p>

<p>Tables 1, 2 and 3 show comparable information for three groups of patients: Table 1 summarizes all patients who presented to our clinic for cancer treatment, and who stayed in our treatments for at least two weeks. Table 2 shows the same information for those who chose to eat sweetened foods. Table 3 shows the same information for those who chose to avoid sweetened foods. The remission rate is different for all patients: 151 / 317 = 48% and those who ate sweetened foods: 9 / 29 = 31% and those who avoided sweetened foods: 142 / 288 = 49%. However, the difference in these three groups is even more pronounced if we consider those patients who stayed with our treatments until either remission or death, as in Tables 4, 5 and 6.</p>

<p>Comparing all patients who were steadfast in the treatments (Table 4) with the sweetened food eaters, who were steadfast in all but dietary recommendations (Table 5), we see that 151 / 183 = 83% went into remission, but only 9 / 25 = 36% of the sweetened food eaters went into remission. 90% of the steadfast patients who avoided sweeteners went into remission.<br />
Of all patients who were steadfast in the treatments, (including our sweetened food eaters), 32 / 183 = 17% died, but considering only the sweetened food eaters who were otherwise steadfast in the treatments, 16 / 25 = 64% died. Of the steadfast patients who avoided sweeteners, 16 / 158 = 10% died.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Consuming sweetened foods (other than stevia sweetened foods) made a significant difference in patient outcome across both all stages and all types of cancer among patients presenting to our clinic. Therefore, we recommend that the diet of cancer patients not contain sweeteners other than stevia.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Quality Whole Foods Are The Currency Of Life</h2>
<p>Whether you believe in creation, or evolution or are undecided, most of us would agree that our bodies (that is our anatomy and physiology and biochemistry &#8211; which is really just how we process food and what we do with it) is substantially the same as that of our recent ancestors. So if we have the same body types and we process our food the same way as our great grandparents and great-great grandparents, can we expect dramatic consequences from eating the processed, irradiated, genetically engineered, refined and synthetic &#8220;foods&#8221; that our ancestors never had access to and never ate?</p>
<p>Indeed we can expect those consequences! Let&#8217;s consider what happens if you substitute soda or Kool-Aid in your washing machine instead of water. How much longer would it work? What happens if you feed mayonnaise to a goldfish, french fries to a cow, donuts to a horse, assorted chemicals to a human? What happens when we substitute synthetic products for the water and many different nutrients that our cells and our children&#8217;s cells and internal organs need simply to function well? In fact, the very sad consequences of the latest generations&#8217; food choices is becoming more apparent everyday as we are now seeing chronic diseases become epidemic in our society. The United States has the worst health status (life expectancy, morbidity, obesity and infant mortality) of any of the industrialized nations, yet we spend the most money on &#8220;healthcare&#8221; and take the most pharmaceuticals. Why are Americans getting sicker and sicker while drugging ourselves more and more?</p>
<p>The great expense of poor food choices is charged to both our bodies and the future, as well as to our wallets. A recent experimental trip to a large fast food chain cost $17.26 for four sandwiches and four &#8220;regular fries.&#8221; For my $17.26, I got 2.80 pounds, net weight, of &#8220;food,&#8221; once I had thrown out all the packaging. This amounted to over six dollars per pound, which is triple the average price of organic foods in a typical health food store. And most people think that fast food is cheap, and organic food is expensive!</p>
<div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Forget What You Ate Until Today.</h2>
<span id="g1-space-8" class="g1-space " style="height:0.5em;"></span>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">What you eat from now on is vitally important to your continued well-being.</h4>
</div>
<p>Until just a few generations ago, our ancestors were wonderfully fit and healthy compared with present-day generations. The majority lived good, active, healthy lives and ultimately died peacefully in their sleep. Today that is a rarity. Whereas chronic disease, chronic pain, and prolonged end-of-life care were rare for our ancestors, it is becoming much more the expected outcome for us. What single difference between these two centuries impacts our bodies the strongest? The overwhelmingly different factor in our lives is the refined, processed, chemical products that we eat, that our ancestors simply did not eat.</p>
<div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Do We Really Want To Live This Way?</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Let&#8217;s apply some good, plain common sense to food choices.</h4>
</div>
<p>Naturopathic physicians have come to understand that, just as you cannot pour soft drinks into your car and expect good performance, you cannot put synthetic and poor quality solids and liquids into your body and expect continued good health. Also, if our species, for better or worse, whether created, evolved or in-between, performs best on whole foods (vegetables, fruits, nuts, eggs, meats, etc.), then we can understand that putting synthetic liquid or solid wastes in your body will simply trash your most valuable possession: your own good health.</p>
<div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">What&#8217;s So Great About Good Health?</h3>
</div>
<p>Neighbors, co-workers, teachers, mentors and even friends can come and go. Money comes and goes. Material possessions can only be enjoyed by people who are comfortable in their own bodies. On the other hand, your good healthy body, as you preserve and care for it now, is your most valuable financial asset and your very best assurance of a strong youth full of opportunities, as well as a secure, successful middle age and retirement years. There is a lot about naturopathic medicine that is just good plain common sense. As Henry Lindlahr, one of the founding fathers of naturopathic medicine, said in Philosophy of Natural Therapeutics &#8211; &#8220;Medicines are in conformity with the constructive principle in nature insofar as they, in themselves, are not injurious or destructive to the human organism and insofar as they act as tissue foods and promote the neutralization and elimination of morbid matters and poisons.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, this is exactly the goal of naturopathic medicine: to point out the foods that the patient needs, to promote the elimination of toxins, and above all to follow Hippocrates&#8217; instruction to First Do No Harm. In fact, First Do No Harm is the first of the naturopathic principles.</p>
<p>Lindlahr instructed doctors to give patients what they need, take away the toxins that destroy health, and to know when to refrain from doing too much. What could be more important or helpful for a doctor to do for his or her patients than that?</p>
<div>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">It Is Never Too Late To Improve Your Health.</h5>
</div>
<div>
<p>Food choices are a fork in the road that is always in front of you, where one way leads to discomfort and disease, and the other leads to enjoyable life. With every supermarket item you either stop at or walk past, every restaurant that you either stop at or drive past, allowing you a better choice than what you may have made before.</p>
</div>
<p>But can we just turn 180 degrees from soda and fries on the one hand to whole foods on the other hand? How easy is it to start eating collard greens or squash or walnuts? Many people cringe at the idea of eating unfamiliar vegetables, such as arugula, mustard greens, turnip, etc. This is a result of never having eaten these foods prepared in an appetizing and satisfying way. I, along with the rest of my family, also had unthinkingly avoided mustard greens, out of a mistaken assumption of what they might taste like. Then I noticed the fine print on the label of the organic mustard greens from Cal-Organic Farms suggested a recipe, which I have modified as follows: fry some turkey bacon or regular (pork) bacon in a large pot and chop it in small pieces. Add washed, chopped mustard greens and enough water to cover. Boil the mustard greens, but only until slightly wilted. Too many people make the mistake of cooking greens to death, and then being displeased by both the color and the texture of the severely disintegrated leaves that result. What you are looking for is a little wilting, but with the color still bright, and still a succulent, pleasant (believe it or not) flavor. Cynthia Lair ND has written a wonderful cookbook with similar recipes titled Feeding the Whole Family.</p>
<p>So in general, what should we eat, ideally? In addition to the above cookbook, there are two other books that may be considered as good general nutritional guides, one a best-selling paperback, and the other a nutrition textbook. The first is Age Defying Diet, by the well-known but often misinterpreted Dr. Robert Atkins. If we manage to put out of our minds for a moment the triple bacon cheeseburgers and candy bars bearing his name that we have come to associate with Dr. Atkins, then there is a lot to be gained from Age-Defying Diet. Quite surprisingly, Atkins encourages much vegetables and fruits along with the meat, dairy, eggs and nuts in his book. In fact, at one point he suggests eating six cups of green vegetables per day. Dr. Atkins&#8217; arguments for a whole foods diet are very well documented from hundreds of research article citations. This is in addition to the experiences of approximately 30,000 patients who came through the Atkins Center during his lifetime. In fact, he says, &#8220;I know from my own experience with thousands of patients and from avidly reading numerous studies from Europe and the United States that those who consume a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables have significantly better health profile than those who eat other carbohydrates&#8230;&#8221; Robert Atkins MD, Age-Defying Diet. The reason that many people think of meat-only diets in connection with Dr. Atkins is because his weight-loss regimen is considerably more protein-heavy than his maintenance diet, which he describes in Age-Defying Diet. It is the maintenance diet that you want to begin and make peace with, and stay with, in order to successfully and contentedly live on all the foods you need and only the foods you need.</p>
<p>Even better is Dr. Joseph Mercola&#8217;s book Total Health Cookbook and Program. Dr. Mercola appreciates the differences among the various metabolic types. Some individuals should have a diet that somewhat favors meat while others should have a diet that somewhat favors vegetables. Of course everyone should include some of both in their daily diet. Included in the book is a section on determining your metabolic type.</p>
<p>Another wonderful and well-referenced book on nutrition, that is more oriented toward the health care professions, is Medical Nutrition from Marz, by Russell Marz, ND. Dr. Marz does a wonderful job of bringing the biochemistry to life and relating nutritional strategies to various disease states. However, a companion primer on biochemistry may be necessary for the uninitiated reader.</p>
<div>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Here Are The Best Foods In A Nutshell, Including The Nut:</h5>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">Your body already truly and deeply loves vegetables, even if your taste buds don&#8217;t love them yet.</h6>
</div>
<p>Maximize whole vegetables. These are best organic and either raw or minimally cooked. In fact, fill up on vegetables all you like. That way you&#8217;ll have less room for junk. If this sounds too simple to be true, remember that this ridiculously simple rule is the food maxim of healthy, slim adults. Try it, even if you only do it late in the day or every other day. If you can&#8217;t find much fresh organic food in your area, try looking into the new movement called Community Supported Agriculture. This is a fast growing movement of small local farms throughout the United States that sell fresh seasonal food, usually organic, by subscription. You either pick it up at the farm or at an intermediate location, or they deliver to you. See <a href="http://www.wilson.edu/robyn-van-en-center">www.csacenter.org</a>. Once you try organic food right from the field, that has not been trucked hundreds or thousands of miles, you&#8217;ll love the freshness of the produce so much, it would be hard to go back to supermarket food that has either been sitting around two weeks before you buy it, or worse, that came off an assembly line overlooking the industrial landscape surrounding the New Jersey turnpike. (That is where your processed food additives and flavorings and colorings come from, you know.) You think junk food can be addicting? Try healthy food! Freshness and taste and the deepest satisfaction of your body&#8217;s basic metabolic needs are food addictions too! Once you are hooked, let them be your vices.</p>
<div>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">A Rainbow Of Vegetables And Fruits</h5>
</div>
<p>Make your meal a rainbow. Green vegetables are such a staple of a healthy diet that they should be eaten every day. However, wonderful as green vegetables are, they do not provide the full spectrum of nutrients. Remember also the orange vegetables, such as sweet potato, squash, pumpkin and orange bell pepper, which provide the very important flavonoids. Red vegetables, such as tomatoes, are also important for lycopene. The liver alone has several hundred functions. These many jobs require the fuel of each of the different beneficial molecules found in a rich variety of healthy foods. In contrast, such nutrients are not available in junk food, even if they may have been added back in the factory.</p>
<p>Fruits are excellent, but avoid them in any concentrated form. Jams, jellies, fruit juice and other fruit-based processed foods are so concentrated that they produce high insulin responses. Insulin rushes are the very most important thing you need to avoid in order to maintain good health and appropriate weight. If you find yourself able to spend an hour in the kitchen a few times a year, try this simple <a title="Nutrition &amp; Health" href="https://natureworksbest.com/blog/2014/05/20/nutrition/" name="preservesRecipe">recipe</a> for unsweetened preserves.</p>
<p>Have a rainbow of whole fruits for the same reason as having a rainbow of vegetables. You need the nutrients that are represented in the various colors.</p>
<div>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">Meats, Dairy, Nuts, Legumes And Seeds</h6>
</div>
<p>If you seem to do well eating meat, then go for high quality meat. Your best choices are organic, free-range meats. The more people ask for these in supermarkets, the more supermarkets will begin to carry them. In addition to the usual meats &#8211; buffalo, ostrich and venison are all nutritious and quite good. Roasting is better than frying. Organ meats such as liver are more highly nutritious than muscle meats, but both are good. Eggs and organic and raw cheese and milk will be beneficial to some and allergenic to others. It is best to pay attention to your body and watch for symptoms after eating dairy and eggs. The most highly allergenic foods are dairy, wheat, eggs, soy, citrus, peanuts and corn. That doesn&#8217;t mean that you should avoid all of them, but these 7 foods are less digestible than others, so watch for feelings of fatigue or discomfort after eating them, even 12-24 hours later.</p>
<p>Snack on nuts and seeds. Walnuts, pecans, almonds, hazelnuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, as well as butters made from seeds and nuts are very highly nutritious and should be eaten frequently, unless one is allergic. Walnuts, high in omega-3 fatty acids, are a very important brain food for everyone, especially children. Other foods high in omega-3 fatty acids are flaxseed, grass-fed beef and salmon. Legumes are an important source of protein and other nutrients, especially when combined with rice or other whole grains.</p>
<div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Leave The Refined Carbs Behind At The Supermarket</h2>
</div>
<p>Minimize, or better yet get rid of, refined grains and refined sugar of all kinds. These contribute nothing to your health, as all nutrition has been extracted from them. Worse, they actively deplete good health, because they cause excessive insulin release, which is the worst factor in arterial plaque, as well as countless other health problems. Try to eliminate as much as possible breads, cookies, bagels, pretzels, donuts, candy and sodas. But how do you do this when daily life is so full of these items? The battle over junk food is won or lost at the supermarket, not at home. In other words, if you come home with a box of cookies, you will probably eat them, because after all, being only human, it is nearly impossible to let them simply sit there in the cabinet a few feet away from you the same way the whole wheat pasta has been sitting there for six months. Rather, fighting the willpower battle at the supermarket is made much easier by simply walking on past the unhealthy food. Or better, not even walking down those aisles. In fact, some naturopaths advise to simply shop the periphery of the supermarket and nothing more. That way, you pick up the whole fruits and vegetables, meat and dairy, and come home with a much healthier, and less expensive, set of grocery items than if you had gone up and down the interior aisles where all the processed foods are.</p>
<div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Only Kind Of Diet That Will Do You Any Good</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">is one that you can be comfortable with long-term and features the above criteria.</h4>
</div>
<p>Don&#8217;t count calories. You could drive yourself up a wall trying to figure out how many calories you are eating or should eat. Counting calories is almost certain to end up making you feel deprived of food while wasting your time with meaningless numbers.</p>
<p>Above all, make a kind of peace with this way of eating. Find a quantity and variety of vegetables, fruits, meat, dairy and nuts and legumes that is so comfortable and so easy for you that you stay with these foods long term. The goal is to have such a well balanced and therefore satisfying diet, that there is nothing wanting and thus no need to cheat. You will find that some of these foods are so tasty that they become comfort foods for you. Rely on these when you feel the need for a comfort food. Give it at least sixteen weeks. If you are not feeling considerably better in that time and much thinner (if you are already overweight), then you need to modify this diet, so that it is something that you don&#8217;t feel the need to cheat on. Cheating, as every dieter knows, costs so much that you may as well glue cookies on your thighs and tummy rather than eating them. Enrich your whole foods diet with so many different whole foods of your liking that you feel no need to cheat. Keep enough healthy convenience foods (i.e. fruits and nuts) on hand that you reach for those when you need to snack, because they are so visually appealing, fragrant, tasty, seasonally fresh and in great variety in your colorful and overflowing fruit bowl. If you feel you need something more filling with your fruit snack or fruit and nut snack, have some organic cheese with it. These items also pack and keep very nicely in a bag to take to work.</p>
<div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What Do You Do If Eating Whole Foods Seems To Be Too Much Of A Change?</h2>
</div>
<p>Start very slow and very easy. Dr. Steven Ehrlich of Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine is sensitive to people trying to change their diet, and the frustration that they may feel. Dr. Ehrlich instructs his students, &#8220;Have your patients add something rather than subtract from their diet To start, have them eat one apple a day.&#8221; Here is an almost free change that one can make, a good tasting, easy to store, easy to carry, highly nutritious convenience food that is available year round. (Not to mention that it&#8217;s probably the least messy thing you can eat on the go). Of course, after the patient masters this, Dr. Ehrlich gradually challenges his patients further with more and more good foods, but always gently, at the patient&#8217;s own pace, considering individual appetites, and with great compassion. Surreptitiously (and insidiously!) the unhealthy items in the diet start falling away as patients fill up more and more on apples and later other whole fruits and vegetables. Let us all live up to such wonderful compassion as Dr Ehrlich teaches, as we ever so gently redirect others away from the plethora of processed foods that surround us in the supermarkets and the highway fast food outlets toward something more tasty, more nutritious, more aligned with our genetically acquired needs, and . . . more natural!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Which Sweeteners Are Healthy?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which sweeteners are healthy to eat? <a href="https://natureworksbest.com/blog/2014/05/27/sugar-feeds-cancer-growth/">Do some sweeteners cause cancer</a>? There are many questions around natural and artificial sweeteners that we will touch on in this article. While many of the illnesses associated with cane sugar are still major health concerns especially in the United States, high fructose corn syrup is now the reigning king of junk food. Sodas, juices and other beverages and foods targeted to young children are now replete with high fructose corn syrup. As with many market forces, this new ascendance of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has to do with cost. HFCS has become cheaper to grow and incorporate into processed foods than cane sugar. Aside from cost, other factors, such as how easily it blends into foods has made it popular in the processed food industry.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Damage Caused By HFCS &amp; Cane Sugar</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, the health problems associated with HFCS are as bad or worse than regular cane sugar. Both have enormous health problems associated with them, and damage to all the major organs have been noted with ingestion of both. We can see some of the <strong>obvious damage caused by sugar</strong> since almost everybody has noted a child&#8217;s behavior becoming bad after sugar ingestion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, on a more subtle level, <em>sugar causes damage</em> to the pancreas, the large intestine, the immune system, and other organ systems. For both sweeteners the white blood cells, which are the fighters of your immune system are inactivated after sugar ingestion, anywhere from 5 to 24 hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both sugar and high fructose corn syrup cause accelerated aging, because of the oxidative damage to the cells and tissues of the body. If you are going to a spa or cosmetic surgeon to turn back the clock, then treating yourself with sugar or high fructose corn syrup afterward, you are rushing the clock forward again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The insulin released by sugar or fructose ingestion also cakes a relentless plaque on the cardiovascular system, leading to heart disease. In fact, the three major killers of our time, heart disease, cancer and diabetes, are all related to consumption of these sweeteners.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Health Problems Caused By HFCS</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And all of these health problems apply to high fructose corn syrup. However, HFCS has its own harmful effects. Fructose even more than sucrose interferes with copper metabolism, so that copper deficiencies result. This creates abnormalities in the heart and liver particularly. Copper deficiencies are increasingly common with the standard American diet. This is compounded by the fact that people no longer eat organ meats. Liver with onions was a staple back in the 60&#8217;s when I was growing up, yet it is a rarity in today&#8217;s diet. Liver is by far the best source of copper in food.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fructose also interferes with your cells&#8217; uptake of insulin, just as happens in Type 2 Diabetes, which is the common kind of diabetes. Just as in diabetes, a fructose consumer must then pump out ever more insulin, which creates health problems everywhere in the body as it lays down a thick plaque in your arteries. This is why you may know of diabetics who have gone blind or developed kidney disease, or have had one extremity or another amputated. The reason is that the eyes, the kidneys and the fingers and toes are extraordinarily sensitive to blood flow and cannot function without a plentiful supply. Sooner or later, insufficient blood to these areas produces cellular death and the loss of the organ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fructose also is even worse than sugar regarding its depletion of minerals in the body. Magnesium is quite deficient in our society, the second most common nutrient deficiency after folic acid. Yet fructose leaches out magnesium and iron among other minerals. As a result of magnesium loss, headaches, constipation and muscle cramps may occur.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abnormalities in the liver have been seen in animal experiments. Those fed high levels of fructose developed cirrhosis and fatty liver, which is the same liver pathology resulting from years of alcoholism or long-term use of most pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heart disease is also a problem. HFCS has been tied to elevated blood cholesterol and has been shown to contribute to blood clots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you probably already know, two of the most devastating, non-traffic accident events that can happen to you, namely stroke and heart attack, are the result of a blood clot ending up in the wrong place. In a stroke, a blood clot has broken loose and traveled through your bloodstream, lodging in a narrow vessel in the brain, and cutting off all life in that part of the brain, downstream from the blood clot. In a heart attack, the same thing is happening, but the clot gets stuck in a small blood vessel in the heart, which kills that part of the heart. So much for sugar and high fructose corn syrup.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Aspartame, Splenda And Sucralose</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The artificial sweeteners, Aspartame, Splenda and Sucralose all have their origin in pesticide or military applications as chemical warfare, and should not be even remotely considered appropriate for entry into the body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, aspartame is now the sweetener of choice in not only &#8220;diet&#8221; foods and sodas, but also most chewing gum and other products marketed to children for their ingestion. These products should never even be considered for adults or children. They have been tied to neurological disorders, from Parkinson&#8217;s to Multiple Sclerosis, simply because <strong>they are neurotoxins (nerve killers)</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The history of Splenda would be comical if it did not have such sad results in our population. While studying a neurotoxin one day in a lab, the senior researcher called out to the junior researcher &#8220;test it,&#8221; and the novice thought he heard &#8220;taste it&#8221; and called back &#8220;It tastes sweet.&#8221; The senior researcher came rushing in. &#8220;What? Are you crazy? I said test it, not taste it.&#8221; &#8220;But it&#8217;s sweet.&#8221; &#8220;Really? Let me have some of that.&#8221; So the senior researcher tastes it, smiles and a new chapter in synthetic foods begins. The full story of this episode appeared in The New Yorker magazine over a year ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Honey, unfortunately, isn&#8217;t much better at all. It is 82 percent sugar, and its glycemic index is either 83 or 124, depending on which glycemic table you look at. It is metabolized as sugar is, with the extreme highs and lows of unstable blood sugar, insulin flooding then crashing, and following the sickeningly familiar cycle of diabetes pathogenesis.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Stevia &#8211; The Healthy Sweetener</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can only answer with one word: <strong>stevia</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First I have to say that there is no stevia interest group or trade association or anybody else that would even want to bribe me to say this. Stevia is a South American plant that will grow all the way up to Canada, and even in arid conditions if it gets enough water. It will grow even at 110 degrees, and dies back if the weather goes below freezing. The sweetener is basically the crushed plant leaf, so there is no extra processing. Those same leaves can be put into a tea ball and steeped 30 minutes in warm water to create a liquid stevia extract &#8211; easy, fast and non-messy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those of you without stevia plants in your backyard, stevia is sold by a number of brands in most major health food stores. It comes in the powdered extract as well as liquid. Personally I recommend the liquid as being more manageable because the powder gets airborne so easily that you will know and taste it easily if someone nears you pours it into food.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stevia has a centuries-long history of safe use by native South American peoples. Hundreds of tests have now been performed around the world, and it has been found to be absolutely non-toxic. It is now among the most common sweeteners in Japan and several South American countries, and has been increasingly so for the last 20+ years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stevia may actually even be good for the teeth, which would be a radical first for a sweetener, because it has been shown to inhibit the development of plaque. Stevia also has zero <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glycemic index</a>. It won&#8217;t monkey with your sugar or insulin as the other sweeteners do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The nutritive value of stevia is however negligible. After all, it only takes 2 to 6 drops of the liquid extract to sweeten a cup of coffee or tea. So even though there are phytonutrients, that is naturally occurring nutritious biochemicals in the plant that have nutritional benefit, you would not be able to stand eating even a whole leaf. At 200 times sweeter than sugar, it&#8217;s just too darn sweet!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Dr. Weston Price &#8211; Widespread Disease Is A Modern Phenomenon</h2>
<p>We know from studying isolated traditional societies, people who are relatively untouched by civilization, that what is good for younger people is generally good for older people. There are some important exceptions that I will get to later.</p>
<p>The first modern researcher to take a detailed look at the eating habits of non-industrialized people was a dentist, Dr. Weston Price. In the 1930&#8217;s Dr. Price traveled all over the world and found 14 groups of people from Africa to the Eskimos to remote parts of Europe, and found that almost every member of the tribe or village enjoyed excellent health. They were free of chronic disease, mental illness and tooth decay. They were strong and produced healthy children easily, and remained physically active and agile into old age.</p>
<p>Here is what he found when he looked at their diets: local, entirely natural foods. Of course, the foods were all organic, because that simply means lack of synthetic pesticides. Far from being a gourmet luxury item, the entire human diet was always organic until experts decided for us that we could tolerate strong neurotoxic pesticides on all the food we ingested. And so we started eating non-organic food, a first in human history.</p>
<div id="attachment_2479" style="width: 245px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://natureworksbest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/weston-a-price.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2479" class="size-medium wp-image-2479" src="https://natureworksbest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/weston-a-price-235x300.jpg" alt="Dr. Weston A. Price, NatureWorksBest" width="235" height="300" srcset="https://natureworksbest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/weston-a-price-235x300.jpg 235w, https://natureworksbest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/weston-a-price.jpg 804w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2479" class="wp-caption-text">http://ppnf.org/</p></div>
<p>But getting back to the remote isolated villages that Dr. Price found &#8211; Almost every group ate plenty of seafood or other animal proteins and fats in the form of organ meats and dairy products. They valued animal fat as absolutely necessary to good health. They ate fats and meats, as well as fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds and whole grains. Of all the primitive diets that Dr. Price studied, all contained some raw foods, both animal and vegetable.</p>
<p>These are the foods on which these isolated people from remote regions of Ireland to Switzerland to Africa were able to thrive, to endure the harsh winters and hot summers without indoor heating or air conditioning, to produce generation after generation of healthy babies and children who could do the same.</p>
<p>Dr. Price compared them with &#8220;civilized people&#8221; that is people who had learned to rely more on the foods of the industrial revolution &#8211; refined and processed foods, pasteurized milk and sugar. When he looked at the civilized people he found rampant tooth decay &#8211; remember Dr. Price was a dentist &#8211; as well as rampant infectious diseases, infertility and chronic degenerative diseases of various kinds.</p>
<p>Even those children from the primitive societies who had now adopted the industrialized diet &#8211; these children had crooked teeth, deformed bone structure and a tendency to have every sort of medical problem.</p>
<p>Dr. Price then concluded that it was the so-called civilized diet, the one with refined carbohydrates such as flour and sugar, as well as industrially processed fats and oils were to blame for the quick decline in health, just from one generation to the next.</p>
<p>In the years since the 1930&#8217;s many studies have unanimously confirmed what Dr. Price found, and I will boil it down to the essence.</p>
<p>Those who eat whole vegetables, fruits, meats, dairy, eggs and grains, live long active lives without physical problems or diseases.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those who eat processed foods &#8211; that&#8217;s the kind you buy in a package with dozens of ingredients, half of them synthetic, the people who eat sugar and other sweeteners, the people who eat bread and other flour products &#8211; these are the people who run into health problems, disease, stiffness, a resulting lack of physical activity with further slow physical degeneration. It has been shown again and again.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Major Diseases Were Rare Until A Few Generations Ago</h2>
<p>All of our major diseases &#8211; cancer, heart disease, and diabetes &#8211; were extremely rare until a few generations ago. In fact, the first heart attack in human history was not described in the medical literature until 1912! This was less than a hundred years ago. Now a heart attack is a very obvious event. It&#8217;s not that Hippocrates or the other medical greats of the past would have missed something ike that. Yet nobody wrote about the phenomenon of heart attack until the year 1912. Here is why heart attacks started then and just kept increasing and increasing until we have rampant heart disease now. It was about the turn of the century 1900 when refined and processed foods started coming into the diet. Sugar was starting to be distributed throughout Europe and North America from the West Indies, and whereas Americans had about a half cup of sugar per person per year until the year 1900, now your average American gets that much sugar in a day.</p>
<p>Now I am not talking about natural fruits. Please don&#8217;t get so confused on this point as many people do. Eating fruit is very different from eating sweetened desserts. With fruit, the fiber slows down the entry of the natural unrefined sugar into your blood stream. In other words, your blood sugar stays moderate, and your insulin stays moderate. With desserts on the other hand &#8211; even with fruit juices &#8211; your blood sugar surges upward, and then soon afterward your insulin surges also. Now insulin has two main instructions to the body. One is, now it is time to lay down a layer of fat. The other is to cake a plaque along the inside of your arteries. Don&#8217;t let anyone confuse you on this point. It is not your cholesterol that cakes up your arteries so much as the insulin that you secrete and carry in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>Various lifestyles have been observed among centenarians. Of people living past 100, some smoke; some do not. Some drink; some do not. But all those living to 100 had low blood sugar and low blood insulin.</p>
<p>Again your best defense against chronic diseases is to use the following ingredients: vegetables, fruits, meats, eggs &#8211; all preferably organic, local and / or free range when available. Do the best you can here. We all have to make compromises on some items that never seem to be available in organic form.</p>
<p>And here is how to incorporate them:</p>
<ul>
<li>raw salads, of all kinds</li>
<li>soups</li>
<li>stews and casseroles with any kind of meat and any kinds of vegetables</li>
<li>snacks that involve nuts, cheese, whole fruit in any combination or alone</li>
</ul>
<p>In this respect, the optimal nutrition for seniors is comparable to the optimal nutrition at any age.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * *</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Nutrition For Seniors</h3>
<p>There are few ways in which optimal nutrition for people over age 65 is different from nutrition for everybody else.</p>
<p>One is that chewing tends not to be as vigorous as in youth, partly because of dental issues that have arisen over the previous decades. This leads to a preference for softer foods that are not so tough and chewy as a young person might tolerate. The teeth are the first food breakdown tools, and when large unchewed pieces are swallowed, it leaves that job for the rest of the GI tract, which is not really equipped to make that first physical breakdown. So chewing is essential, unless the foods eaten are all semi-liquid.</p>
<p>Otherwise, after a while various kinds of GI distress result, problems such as heartburn or reflux, malabsorption and irritable bowel syndrome.</p>
<p>Another of the main differences is what happens in your gut when you digest food. As we age, the pancreas decreases its function somewhat, so that there aren&#8217;t so much of the digestive enzymes as in youth.</p>
<p>Enzymes are pretty nifty chemicals that break down your food to smaller digestible pieces, from big unabsorbable molecules to small, easily assimilated molecules. Yet, after age 50, the food still comes down the gut tube now without as much of these marvelous enzymes to help turn it into the kinds of micronutrients, that is the vitamins and minerals that your body can absorb.</p>
<p>There are things you can do to enhance this process. Smaller more frequent meals are less of a challenge for the pancreas. For example, papaya and pineapple are two foods that provide some of the digestive enzymes. The health food stores have more complete enzyme supplements. And then if you see a naturopathic physician, we consider what is happening with your digestion and prescribe enzyme supplements that are considered for you individually.</p>
<p>In fact, at this point, I have to discuss individual differences, because as life continues, the way that one person may begin to have problems or some deterioration is different than what may happen to another individual. In other words, I have never had a headache in my life. Really. But I&#8217;ve had tummy aches. You may have a cast-iron stomach, able to eat anything without a problem, but perhaps you get headaches. As we age, these differences tend to persist and sometimes get worse. So that&#8217;s why as a naturopathic physician, I schedule a two-hour initial visit. That gives the patient a chance to discuss pretty much everything they feel is important, and for me to get a good idea what&#8217;s going on and to formulate a treatment plan.</p>

<span id="g1-space-9" class="g1-space " style="height:1.5em;"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Migraines &amp; Magnesium</h2>
<p>Migraines are sheer torture for those who suffer them. Excruciating pain from a strong light, sounds or even gentle touch along with a constant head-splitting miserable pain that can drive the victim straight to bed for hours is a typical experience among migraineurs, as they are called. Painful symptoms may or may not be preceded by an aura, which is a visual disturbance that may involve flickering lights, spots, wavy lines, etc. Disturbances of the other senses may also occur.</p>
<p>Migraineurs miss an average of 19.6 workdays per year on account of migraine headaches, and this costs employers an average of $3000 per year per employee. The misery of migraines is certainly most intense for the victims but also ripples out to the society at large.</p>
<p>Magnesium is now starting to get attention in the natural health press as being helpful for migraines, cluster headaches and tension headaches. One study showed that patients with migraines got almost immediate results for receiving 1 gram of magnesium sulfate intravenously. In 32 out of 40 patients complete elimination of migraine pain was observed within 15 minutes. Other physicians have prescribed oral magnesium oxide or other magnesium supplements, with good but slower effect.</p>
<p>Magnesium is one of the most common nutrient deficiencies in the United States. The average American diet is estimated to have only 250 mg of magnesium per day, whereas the average Chinese diet has 650 mg. For therapeutic purposes, it is often enough to dose 400 to 800 mg of magnesium to stop a migraine.</p>
<p>There is a very crude but useful formula that explains magnesium&#8217;s principal effect with regard to a number of body processes. It is: &#8220;Calcium contracts; magnesium relaxes.&#8221; So what happens when magnesium is relatively deficient, at least compared to your level of calcium, is that your body will default to contracted muscles, whether skeletal, cardiac or smooth muscle, which means that any of the following symptoms of magnesium deficiency may become apparent:</p>
<ul>
<li>tension headaches</li>
<li>migraine or cluster headaches</li>
<li>tendency to muscle cramps and clenching</li>
<li>narrowing of blood vessels due to the contraction of the smooth muscle in the walls of the blood vessels</li>
<li>insomnia due to tense muscles</li>
<li>twitching, i.e. of eyelid or extremities</li>
<li>constipation</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an observable relationship among some of these symptoms. For example, migraineurs are very often constipated as a rule. Is it that the constipation leads to retention of toxins, which lead to migraine? Or is it that both constipation and migraines are resulting from magnesium deficiency?</p>
<p>Further complicating the matter is how exactly migraines function, that is the mechanism of migraines. Two main hypotheses exist for how migraine pain occurs. The more recent and popular hypothesis is that there is altered electrical activity in the brain prior to the onset of the migraine, which then leads to less activity of the neurons in a given part of the brain, which then leads to a local acute inflammation that affects the nerve roots.</p>
<p>An older hypothesis is that alteration in the diameter of blood vessels is what triggers migraine. Although this hypothesis is not as popular now, it is consistent with lower magnesium levels in the brain. My research in the early 1990&#8217;s also supports this older hypothesis.</p>
<p>I surveyed figure skaters, both freestyle skaters who incorporate fast spins into their skating, as well as ice dancers, who maintain a similar level of activity, in the same cold environment of the ice rink, for a similar amount of time, among similarly fit people. In other words, the main difference that I isolated is that the freestylists did practice spins, while the ice dancers did not have any such centrifugal effect on their bodies.</p>
<p>My hypothesis was that freestylists would experience centrifugation of blood away from the central axis of a spin, whereas the ice dancers would not. We already know that centrifugation of fluid elsewhere in the body occurs during skaters&#8217; spinning. One example involves the sit spin, also known as the &#8220;snot spin&#8221; by some because the nose is outside of and pointing away from the axis of rotation. At times, the overactive zoom of TV cameras during high profile ice competitions has displayed this mucus-flinging phenomenon to the cringing public. Another example is that high-performing freestylists can spin so fast that it makes their fingers warm and flushed, we can only presume from a flow of blood toward the extremities.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the freestylists had a higher incidence of migraine, including migraines that began while on the ice. 22% of freestylists, compared with 4% of ice dancers reported migraines. And 91% of the migraineurs reported a change in migraines while skating, mostly mentioning spinning as having a mostly deleterious effect.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>As a primary care physician and Naturopathic Medical Doctor, I have the opportunity to see the common cold in its various stages, from earliest sneezes to the poor, miserable patient whose cold has dragged on for weeks.</p>
<p>When a cold strikes there is a small window of opportunity to turn it around, before the full military engagement of the immune system is launched. The immune system attacks any invaders of the body with such organized force, that a military metaphor is really the most applicable. Once white blood cells and histamine are deployed, there is no way to gracefully turn back. At that point, you can dry up the immune response to the cold with an antihistamine and cough suppressants, but the battle has been engaged, and will need to run its course and resolve somehow.</p>
<p>The early window of opportunity for beating a cold is within the first 24 hours, just as the first symptoms are becoming apparent. Perhaps it is a tickle in the back of your throat or your nose is beginning to run, or your head feels full. At this point, the following interventions have been most helpful:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sleep</h2>
<p>There is no medicine so beneficial and therapeutic as sleep. Take whatever measures and leaves of absence that you have to in order to stay in bed all day when you first come down with a cold. Your employer and co-workers should appreciate that you kept your germs home with you especially after you remind them that the incubation period, when a cold is most contagious, is the first 3 days after symptoms start. The extra rest allows your body such increased ability to recuperate and focus your physical energy on beating the cold that the duration generally is quite a bit shorter than if you continue running around and working.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Wet Sock Treatment</h2>
<p>And while you&#8217;re in bed, you may as well do this old naturopathic standby. The following procedure is wonderful for draining the head and nose of congestion.</p>
<p>You will need a pair of thin cotton socks and a pair of thick wool socks and thick blankets. Wet the cotton socks with cold water. Go to your bed. Put the cotton socks on your feet. Put the dry wool socks over them. Jump into bed under thick covers. Your body will now redirect blood flow downward to warm your feet. By morning the cotton socks will be perfectly dry and warm, and your head and nose should feel less congested.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">High dose Vitamin A</h2>
<p>As good as Vitamin C is for the immune system, Vitamin A is considerably more powerful, and directly strengthens immune function. Unfortunately, high dose Vitamin A is reputed to have side effects, and is therefore only sold in low doses in the health food stores. You will need to obtain high dose Vitamin A (on the order of 100,000 units to 400,000 units) from a naturopathic physician or other knowledgeable health care practitioner. The main concern is that if a pregnant woman takes doses in the several hundred thousands for weeks on end, she could miscarry. The second major concern is a dose in the millions for weeks on end could have a temporarily damaging effect on the liver.</p>
<p>However, when I fight off the first signs of a cold, I only take a few hundred thousand units once, and that&#8217;s it. I seem to be fine and have no cold symptoms for months afterward. However, because of the concerns regarding Vitamin A, you would do best to see your local naturopathic physician for a specific dose apropiate for you. The largest directory of naturopathic physicians in the U.S. is <a href="http://www.naturopathic.org/" target="_blank">www.naturopathic.org</a>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">High dose Vitamin D</h2>
<p>When you do get up from bed, try to get some sunlight, at least on your face for a while. We make Vitamin D from sunlight beginning in our skin, which then passes on to the kidneys and liver for further processing. Vitamin D is another really powerful boost for the immune system. Try to enjoy your 20 minutes per day of sunlight. Because if you don&#8217;t, then you&#8217;ll have to get the second best source of Vitamin D: cod liver oil. Hmmm. With only your face exposed this time of year, better make that 40 minutes of sunlight per day.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Intravenous nutrients</h2>
<p>While at your naturopath&#8217;s office, see if he or she uses intravenous nutrients for general nutritional support in case of a cold such as the one you have. These generally contain a much higher dose of Vitamin C than you would be able to tolerate orally.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Oral Vitamin C</h2>
<p>However, Vitamin C needs to be replaced frequently in the body, so you should also take it orally. The best ones that we can recommend are Electrolyte Stamina or Emergen-C, because these are in the most anti-oxidant form that we have seen. They come in envelopes of powder that you add to a glass of water. It is important that you drink it right away, because the fizzing that you hear as you mix the powder with water is the oxidation process. Once it stops fizzing completely, the drink does not do you nearly as much good. Other somewhat reliable forms of Vitamin C are Ester-C, again to protect the chemically reduced, non-oxidized form of C, or Acerola or Rose Hip C or any vitamin C with bioflavonoids for the same purpose. You will probably be able to tolerate between one and 12 grams (that&#8217;s 1,000 to 12,000 milligrams) of Vitamin C per day. The only side effect with a lot of Vitamin C is some loose stools. Therefore, naturopathic physicians advise our patients suffering with colds to take Vitamin C up to bowel tolerance.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Hydrogen Peroxide In The Ears</h2>
<p>This is another old standby. Place a towel on your pillow. Pour a half capful of standard drugstore hydrogen peroxide in one ear as you lie on your side in bed. You will hear intense bubbling for five or ten minutes. As the bubbles subside, turn over to your other side, and let the hydrogen peroxide drain out of your ear onto the towel that is on your pillow. Now pour another half capful into the other ear and wait another ten minutes. Turn and drain again.</p>
<p>The point of doing this is that hydrogen peroxide is strongly antimicrobial, and the connection between the ear and throat by way of the Eustachian tube is a useful entry point for the antiseptic effects of hydrogen peroxide.</p>
<p>Caution: My readers tend to be among the most well-educated, well-informed segments of the population. However, if there is a way to completely mess something up and cause a problem, a small minority of individuals will manage to do so. Therefore, I&#8217;d better give my standard disclaimer: consult your physician regarding the use of hydrogen peroxide in this manner, and do not, under any circumstances, drink or pour hydrogen peroxide into any other bodily cavity.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Don&#8217;t Eat Sugar</h2>
<p>Ah, yes, everybody&#8217;s favorite cold remedy: no sugar. What?? No sugar!!?? Just when you&#8217;re feeling most miserable and needing some yummy comfort foods washed down with hot chocolate?</p>
<p>I am sorry to inform you that sugar has been known to inactivate your white blood cells, the soldiers of your immune system, for as many as 5 to 24 hours. This is just when you need them to be most effective in helping you beat this cold. So I am afraid you will have to postpone dessert until your cold is completely gone, plus a few days.</p>
<p>And now, take all of the above with a grain of salt. There is another naturopathic pearl that may perplex you. We like to say that the cold is the cure. That is, when you come down with a cold, especially a drippy runny one, there is the opportunity for all of that mucus that you&#8217;ve manufactured to wash through an area of your body that never gets cleansed out otherwise. When you consider that the nasal passages and sinuses and mouth and throat are the first filters of the air pollution that we breathe, car exhaust, pesticides, miscellaneous solvents, etc. then perhaps the flushing that we call the common cold is a needed process for us to go through once or twice a year. Of course, thinking of it that way does not ease your sore throat or congested sinuses. But think how good you&#8217;ll feel when it&#8217;s over!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Wild Cherry Bark (Prunus Serotina)</h2>
<p>Cherry bark is a time-honored remedy for cough, at least since the early nineteenth century. It offers both a demulcent and cough-soothing action for inflamed airway membranes, as well as expectorant function. There is also antitussive effect for relentless or spasmodic coughing. Furthermore, it has numerous flavonoids and flavonol glycosides [1] which provide broad anti-oxidant activity. Anti-oxidants are important during upper respiratory infections, as with all infections, because of their immune-enhancing action.</p>
<p>The pleasant taste of wild cherry bark makes it a good choice for cough in children or other hard-to-please coughers. <a href="http://www.honeygardens.com/" target="_blank">www.honeygardens.com</a> offers a cough syrup with raw honey and apple cider vinegar, which have a good reputation also for their effect on cough.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The</strong> <strong>Natural Alternatives To Ritalin And Adderall</strong></h2>
<p>One might expect an article on this topic to mention an educational setting, specific nutrients or perhaps even a time-honored folk remedy for ADD/ADHD children, all of which will be mentioned later in this article. Such treatments, as well as the standard pharmaceuticals, Ritalin and Adderall, all start with the basic assumption that a child has a problem that needs fixing.</p>
<p>However, it is first necessary to turn the camera 180 degrees and take a look at the adults and the society that would perceive an active, energetic young child as an ill misfit and give him a drug that is chemically very similar to street drugs. Just like cocaine, Ritalin raises levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that facilitates concentration and confidence. But Ritalin is actually classified as an amphetamine and is a stimulant like other amphetamines, having a concentration-enhancing effect on children. Ritalin is not widely considered to be addictive, but once a Ritalin prescription is begun, a child often shows even less ability to concentrate without it, and thus the dependence is established.</p>
<p>Numerous writers on the subject agree that Ritalin is overprescribed and that it is used to avoid having to deal with bigger questions about our culture and our values. The amount of Ritalin consumed in the U.S. has more than tripled since 1990, with some young adults now using it too, and often sharing it recreationally as a party drug. As a dopamine-enhancing agent, Ritalin has to some extent replaced two other major dopamine boosters of the past now in disfavor: cocaine and nicotine.</p>
<p>David Nylund argues in his book Treating Huckleberry Finn that in our era, neither Tom Sawyer nor Huck Finn would escape a Ritalin assault on their brains, because it is we grown-ups, not boys, who have changed. In Ritalin Nation, the psychologist Richard DeGrandpre points to our society&#8217;s addiction to speed, in the sense of cell phones and video games and fast, tailgate driving and TV shows that splice together images at hundredth-of-a-second intervals as relentless forces that have helped to create both ADHD and Ritalin. Neuropsychiatrist Sydney Walker in his book The Hyperactivity Hoax also refers to attention disorders and Ritalin as &#8220;symptoms of modern life, rather than symptoms of modern disease.&#8221; Given that fast pace of a child&#8217;s home life, sending a child to a desk where he is expected to sit down and be quiet all day and passively absorb whatever his teacher&#8217;s curriculum has dictated for that day&#8217;s lessons is not a very realistic expectation for any child, except those eager for a break from the breathless pace of their electronic world. For a young healthy boy with no physical pathology to slow him down, such monastery-like expectations must be unbearable. I know it was difficult for me, even as a young girl, even without the testosterone jet fuel. Not surprisingly, three times the ADHD diagnoses are given to boys as to girls.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s zoom the lens in on our society and our values. What is it about childish impulsiveness and particularly boyishness that makes the grown-ups cranky? Is it the unspoken agreement that kids can be controlled best by drugging them? Is it the desperate desire for those rascals who would otherwise be running through the halls raising heck to just walk nicely to their classrooms and sit down and shut up and &#8220;just behave?&#8221; After all if boys are just being boys and tossing each other&#8217;s schoolbooks into the drinking fountains, doesn&#8217;t that mar an otherwise orderly campus and belie the dignity of the academic experience?</p>
<p>The goal-oriented adult would probably answer yes to most of these questions. But it still does not mean that our society must abandon its constitutional commitment to civil liberties and non-violence by forcing brain-altering drugs on its youth. There are other ways to approach the dilemma.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Quiet Achievers vs. ADHD</h2>
<p>To begin, let us broaden our perspective of accomplishment and industry by looking at the quiet achievers at one end of a spectrum and the ADHD kids at the other. Isn&#8217;t it a little odd actually that our very active hunter-gatherer ancestors ended up breeding such sedentary descendants that most of us can sit all day on butt-numbing chairs, grow flabby and focus for so long and so intently on the written page that just about any predatory cat could sneak up behind us and have us for lunch? Well, maybe that is a little odd, but we certainly don&#8217;t need to drug people like that. All we have to do is acknowledge and accommodate their quirks with the traditional classroom.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the ADHD kids are not comfortable with the traditional classroom, so why try to force them into one? Great creative minds such as Maria Montessori and Rudolf Steiner have devised other ways of learning, which have wonderful effect with ADHD kids. Rudolf Steiner started the Waldorf schools, where the classroom segues into real life as seamlessly as possible. Dr. Montessori, Italy&#8217;s first female medical doctor, gave up the practice of medicine in order to closely observe the learning patterns of infants and young children. She was the pioneer of the <a href="http://www.montessori.edu/">self-teaching</a> classroom, where many different types of &#8220;work&#8221; are available around the built-in shelves of the classroom, and children take whatever work they need for as long as they need it. Teachers circulate to tutor one-on-one, or to give a brief group lesson to those children who choose to join and listen. Montessori observed that the attention span of a young child is quite flexible and ideally suited for the length of time required to learn a particular task. Children who have only been exposed to Montessori education since toddler age, and have chosen their own work that entire time end up with remarkably well-balanced academic development by the time of first grade. In other words, the skills that they have already mastered may call to them briefly now and then as review. But what really fascinates them is the task that is just a bit too difficult and that Johnny is already mastering and Janey already mastered and that demands their focus for a while.</p>
<p>And it works for older children with ADHD too. Thomas Armstong, Ph.D., and former special education teacher, author of The Myth of the A.D.D Child finds that for 80% of children labelled ADD/ADHD their symptoms disappear when they are interacting one-on-one with an adult or when they are free to choose learning activities that interest them and are allowed to pace themselves. Walking into such a classroom, one is struck by the quiet, focused industry of the children and would not guess that they had been labelled ADHD.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Montessori and Waldorf classrooms are only becoming widespread for preschoolers, but such education has enormous benefit up through at least high school. Children finishing a Montessori elementary education are among the top performing academically of their municipalities, even on the standardized tests that are not familiar parts of their academic experiences. Librarians easily recognize Montessori elementary students in their public library. They are most often the ones asking for reference materials to write their research papers.</p>
<p>Just as our society is too quick to drug, it is too slow to spread the benefits of <a href="http://montessori.edu/">Montessori education</a>. Still confined to mostly private schools and mostly preschoolers, Montessori-trained teachers and curricula are only now beginning to diffuse into a few public schools and to older children.</p>
<p><strong>* * * * * *</strong></p>
<p>Regarding nutrients, calcium and vitamin B6 supplementation have been used with success to help neurotransmitter balance and thus performance in ADHD kids. However, also keep in mind that nutritional deficiencies can easily spring from the same culture that gave us video games, microwaves and fast-flashing TV. In our haste, we heat up overly processed food for our kids, and skimp on the truly strong calcium bearing foods: raw milk and dark leafy green vegetables. Also, remember that supplementing vitamin B6 isn&#8217;t nearly as helpful as the entire B-complex, because the B vitamins work synergistically. The best way to ensure adequate B-vitamin intake is with a wide range of whole foods, and particularly the organ meats, such as liver and kidneys, where the B-vitamins are most concentrated.</p>
<p>Maria Montessori was not the only ADHD remedy to come out of Italy. A traditional Sicilian remedy for highly active boys who are on their way to a sedentary classroom for the day is a shot of espresso. A stimulant, but not nearly as brain altering as the amphetamines Ritalin and Adderall &#8211; coffee has the paradoxical effect of calming and focusing kids. A consequent addiction to coffee has to then be weighed against the introduction of a synthetic pharmaceutical that is almost identical in its molecular structure and biochemical effect on dopamine as cocaine.</p>
<p>But even more, the kind of viewpoint that marginalizes, labels and medicates the most energetic of our children should be brought into question. Bizarre as that viewpoint is, we should be able to imagine healthy solutions for it without drugging it.</p>
